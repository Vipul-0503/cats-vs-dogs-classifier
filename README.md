# üêæ Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier
_A Machine Learning + Web App Project built during the IBM PBEL Virtual Internship_

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

A clean and user-friendly web application that classifies images as either a **Cat** or a **Dog** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow and deployed through a Flask web server.
> üéì This project was built as part of the **IBM PBEL Virtual Internship** under the domain of AI/ML.

This project blends deep learning and web development to create a real-world AI-powered tool, ideal for showcasing machine learning deployment skills.

## Demo

**Interactive Demo**: Upload a cat or dog image and get an instant prediction from the model.

> **Model**: Custom CNN  
> **Accuracy**: Achieved **87.06%** validation accuracy after 10 epochs
> **Accuracy**: Trained on Cats vs Dogs dataset (binary classification)

## How It Works

1. User uploads a JPG/PNG image of a cat or dog
2. Image is resized and normalized
3. Preprocessed image is passed to a trained CNN
4. Model predicts and displays whether it's a cat or dog

---

## Model Overview

- Built using **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**
- Binary classification: `0 = Cat`, `1 = Dog`
- Input images resized to **150x150**, normalized
- Final trained model saved as `.keras` and used in Flask app
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: **87.06%**
- Training performed over 10 epochs on the **Cats vs Dogs** dataset
- View training notebook: [cats_vs_dogs_model_training_colab.ipynb](cats_vs_dogs_model_training_colab.ipynb)
