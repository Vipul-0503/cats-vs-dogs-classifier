# Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

A clean and user-friendly web application that classifies images as either a **Cat** or a **Dog** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow and deployed through a Flask web server.

This project combines the power of deep learning with a visually engaging interface ‚Äî perfect for showcasing your machine learning skills with real-world application.
